Seed tuber imprinting shapes the next-generation potato microbiome

# Project Description
- Background:
Potato seed tubers are colonized and inhabited by soil-borne microbes, that can affect the performance of the emerging daughter plant in the next season. In this study, we investigated the intergenerational inheritance of microbiota from seed tubers to next-season daughter plants under field condition by amplicon sequencing of bacterial and fungal microbiota associated with tubers and roots, and tracked the microbial transmission from different seed tuber compartments to sprouts.

- Results:
We observed that field of production and potato genotype significantly (P < 0.01) affected the composition of the seed tuber microbiome and that these differences persisted during winter storage of the seed tubers. Remarkably, when seed tubers from different production fields were planted in a single trial field, the microbiomes of daughter tubers and roots of the emerging plants could still be distinguished (P < 0.01) according to the production field of the seed tuber. Surprisingly, we found little vertical inheritance of field-unique microbes from the seed tuber to the daughter tubers and roots, constituting less than 0.2% of their respective microbial communities. However, under controlled conditions, around 98% of the sprout microbiome was found to originate from the seed tuber and had retained their field-specific patterns.

- Conclusions:
The field of production shapes the microbiome of seed tubers, emerging potato plants and even the microbiome of newly formed daughter tubers. Different compartments of seed tubers harbor distinct microbiomes. Both bacteria and fungi on seed tubers have the potential of being vertically transmitted to the sprouts, and the sprout subsequently promotes proliferation of a select number of microbes from the seed tuber. Recognizing the role of plant microbiomes in plant health, the initial microbiome of seed tubers specifically or planting materials in general is an overlooked trait. Elucidating the relative importance of the initial microbiome and the mechanisms by which the origin of planting materials affect microbiome assembly will pave the way for the development of microbiome-based predictive models that may predict the quality of seed tuber lots, ultimately facilitating microbiome-improved potato cultivation.
